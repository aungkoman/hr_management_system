socket get update/delete/insert soldier data
and parse to localStorage and Soldiers Collection to update ui in background
// not to render all the data and no reloading...
just insert/update/delete soldier soldier from socket event to localStoarage :D
Good Luck Bro

by the way 
there is no log system STILL Now
how did you implement it.

* All the operation insert, update, delete event are emitted to all client via socket and accept, render in client appropriately *

we need to write UPDATE function in Server
we need to add own model validation rule
so we can call validate (may be custom method ) to validate the model data, attributes and re inform to the respected local field to recover the condition.


Automatically hide or show modal in insertion and updating operations

Adjust result data and show pol log0

Problem
________
Failed to load http://localhost:8082/new_soldier: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8081' is therefore not allowed access.

Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost:8082/new_soldier. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing).


Solution
________

app.all('/*',function(req,res,next){

  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin','*');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers','X-Requested-With');
  next();

})

Like most I/O operations in Node.js, database access is asynchronous. It’s a great feature, because other operations can be performed while waiting for the results. But if you come from a different programming language, this can be really annoying.
